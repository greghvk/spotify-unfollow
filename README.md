# Unfollow everyone on Spotify

Did you accidentally follow too many people on Spotify like me? Did you try to find a functionality to unfollow them all at once, and failed, like me?
Search no more, this project will allow you to follow everyone with a single click.

Unfortunately, spotify first has to add an endpoint exposing people you follow to their API (see [this](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/4) discussion).
Currently, this website will only allow you to unfollow the artists you follow (not users). Still, this will make unfollowint everyone else by hand easier.
